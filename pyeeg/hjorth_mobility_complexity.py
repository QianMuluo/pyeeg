    """ Compute Hjorth mobility and complexity of a time series from either two
    cases below:
        1. X, the time series of type list (default)
        2. D, a first order differential sequence of X (if D is provided,
           recommended to speed up)

    In case 1, D is computed using Numpy's Difference function.

    Notes
    -----
    To speed up, it is recommended to compute D before calling this function
    because D may also be used by other functions whereas computing it here
    again will slow down.

    Parameters
    ----------

    X
        list

        a time series

    D
        list

        first order differential sequence of a time series

    Returns
    -------

    As indicated in return line

    Hjorth mobility and complexity
